{The Open Tree of Life project constructs a comprehensive, dynamic and digitally-available tree of life by synthesizing published phylogenetic trees along with taxonomic data.
Open Tree of life provides web-service APIs to make the tree estimates, unified taxonomy, and input phylogenetic data available to anyone.
\texttt{opentree} provides a user friendly python wrapper for theses APIs and a set of scripts and tutorials for straightforward downstream data analysis functionality. 
We demonstrate the utility of these tools by generating an estimate of the phylogenetic relationships of all bird genera based on XX published studies, and by capturing a phylogenetic estimate for all taxon observation records available on GBIF for the Merced Vernal Pools Reserve.

Evolutionary history provides a framework to link all life on earth. However, it is not easy to access accurate, up-to-date phylogenetic relationships for arbitrary sets of taxa of interest, even when estimates for those taxa have been made and published (cite various paperssss). Individual phylogenetic estimates are not comprehensive, and therefore seldom contain all taxa of interest. Taxonomic relationships provide a coarse, and often outdated, picture of shared ancestry. 
The Open Tree of Life project (OpenTree) provides a reproducible framework for accessing up-to-date evolutionary relationships for arbitrary sets of taxa across the tree of life.
All data in OpenTree is freely available via API's.
`opentree` provides a user friendly python interface to access these data. In addition `opentree` is packaged with a set of tutorials and scripts to make common downstream analyses straightforward.

\section{Description}
\label{sec2}

\texttt{opentree} is a Python package for accessing and analyzing data from the OpenTree of Life project.
Open Tree of Life stores a wealth of taxonomic and phylogenetic data gathered together in an open-access interoperable framework.
The current synthetic tree \citep{opentreeoflife_open_2019} comprises 2.4 million tips (largely species).
The framework of this tree is provided by a unified taxonomy \citep{opentreeoflife_open_2019-1, rees_automated_2017}.
This taxonomy links unique identifiers across many online taxonomic resources, including NCBI [CITE], GBIF [CITE], as well as user contributed taxonomic amendments contained in [https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/amendments-1].
These taxonomic relationships are refined by evolutionary estimates from 1,216 published papers including 87,000 tip taxa \citep{opentreeoflife_open_2019, redelings_supertree_2017}.
The Open Tree data store, `Phylesystem` \citep{mctavish_phylesystem:_2015} contains all of those published studies, including the mappings between the tips in these published studies, and unique taxonomic identifiers.

All of there data are freely accessible via API calls [https://github.com/OpenTreeOfLife/germinator/wiki/Open-Tree-of-Life-Web-APIs].
\texttt{opentree}  provides an user-friendly wrapper for calling these APIs.
In addition, in converts these between commonly used file formats and data types.
This package allows allows users to generate to data objects in DendroPy, a phylogenetic computing library \citep{sukumaran_dendropy_2010}.


\texttt{opentree} incorporates in python the functionality available in rotl: an {R} package to interact with the Open Tree of Life data \citep{michonneau_rotl:_2016}, as well as additional downstream analysis and interoperability tools.
\texttt{rotl}  has been cited 127 times in the 4 years since its publication, demonstrating a demand for accessible user access to these data.
By providing a python package to interact with these data, we make it straightforward for python users to access and analyze these data.
A python wrapper for Open Tree of Life also makes linking these data with the stable of other Python biodiversity informatics tools such as  `pygbif` (cite).

In addition, \texttt{opentree} expands the toolset available for working with the OpenTree unified taxonomy \citep{rees_automated_2017}.

\section{Services provided by `opentree`}
\label{sec3}


The OpenTree APIs are divided into four main categories, study search, synthetic tree, taxonomy and taxonomic name resolution.
Many analyses integrate calls to each of these subcomponents. 
The `opentree` package links across these services to make common API calls easier.
Some example calls are described here, but all methods and scripts are fully documented, including examples and return formats at \url{https://opentree.readthedocs.io/en/latest/}.

\subsubsection{Study search.---} The OpenTree datastore contains XXX published phylogenetic studies, including XX phylogenetic trees.
These studies and trees are indexed on a number of properties including author name, curator name, and publication information. 
In addition, the tips of these trees are mapped to the unified Open Tree taxonomy making comparisons among estimates, and searching for taxa of interest straightforward.
This allows searching of studies based on taxa contained in the study.
Importantly, this search does not rely on string-matching of what the taxonomic name was at the time of publication - rather it leverages the full suite of synonomies gathered across the input taxonomies to find equivalent taxa across studies, even if the canonical name has changed between publications.
The indexing of these trees is taxonomically explicit as well, so, for example, a search for 'canidae' will find trees with taxa contained in the taxonomic group canidae, even if the term 'canidae' does not itself appear in the tree or tips.
Based on the results of these searches, studies can be viewed in a browser on the OpenTree curator site, or the phylogenies themselves maybe downloaded for comparisons or other downstream use.


\subsubsection{Synthetic tree.---} The centerpiece of the OpenTree tool suite is the synthetic tree.
This tree contains all XX taxa in the OpenTree taxonomy.
Each branch in the tree is informed by published phylogenetic relationships, where they are present in the data store, or by taxonomic relationships where no phylogenetic data is available.
For each node in the synthetic tree, which trees in which studies agree or conflict with
